/*
 * gcma.h - Guaranteed Contiguous Memory Allocator
 *
 * GCMA aims for contiguous memory allocation with success and fast
 * latency guarantee.
 * It reserves large amount of memory and let it be allocated to
 * contiguous memory requests. Because system memory space efficiency could be
 * degraded if reserved area being idle, GCMA let the reserved area could be
 * used by other clients with lower priority.
 * We call those lower priority clients as second-class clients. In this
 * context, contiguous memory requests are first-class clients, of course.
 *
 * With this idea, gcma withdraw pages being used for second-class clients and
 * gives them to first-class clients if they required. Because latency
 * and success of first-class clients depend on speed and availability of
 * withdrawing, GCMA restricts only easily discardable memory could be used for
 * second-class clients.
 *
 * To support various second-class clients, GCMA provides interface and
 * backend of discardable memory. Any candiates satisfying with discardable
 * memory could be second-class client of GCMA using the interface.
 *
 * Currently, GCMA uses cleancache and write-through mode frontswap as
 * second-class clients.
